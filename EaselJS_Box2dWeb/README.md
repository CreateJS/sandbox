Click a creature to make them explode. Append a "debug" param to the query string to see the Box2d debug draw. Like so:
index.html?debug

It also demonstrates using SpriteSheetBuilder to generate run-time spritesheets from vector art produced in Flash Pro.

This approach allows for tiny file sizes - the vector graphics are only 9kb when sent over the wire (gzipped) - and optimal performance on both desktop and mobile. It also allows the art to be scaled dynamically at run time. Append a "scale" param to the query string to see this in action. For example:
index.html?scale=0.25

The "balls.html" and "balls.js" files are generated by Adobe's AnimateCC from the "balls.fla" file.
